## Some Back Story

I have always been drawn towards the quantum realm of our physical world. So when I heard about computers that utilized quantum phenomena to solve problems I decided I had to learn more. 

A classical computer operates on classical bits that can hold a position of 1 or 0. Quantum computing uses something a bit different than the classical 1 or zero. Qubits are the basic unit of information when it comes to quantum computers. The qubit word and the "quantum" part of this revolutionary technology come from the quantum mechanics that the system uses. For the most part, quantum mechanics refers to the properties of atomic or subatomic particles like electrons and photons.

A quantum computer takes the behavior of quantum physics ideas like entanglement, superposition and quantum interference. A qubit can hold a position that is not either a 1 or 0 but somewhere in between and in return can presumably be all possible states instead of one or another. The superposition state of a qubit enables a quantum computer to make multiple calculations at once. With this power a quantum computer that operates on 32 qubits has been shown to keep up with modern day super computers in problem solving.


## What's all the hype about?

As you can probably imagine there is a very large sum of money being thrown into this field of research, development and production. Billions upon billions of dollars are being spent in improving and producing stable quantum machines with that work on as many qubits as possible. Forbes stated that we are for the most part, still in the early days of commercialization when it comes to quantum tech. They also made sure to say, "but we are by no means "stuck" there." 

Keep in mind that quantum computers are not more efficient than classical computers in every aspect. They are built with a purpose and that is usually to solve problems. I found that there are mainly five categories in which quantum computers are more advanced than classical computers and in turn focused on. 

 - Quantum simulation is something that researchers hope advances our knowledge and understanding of quantum systems in physics.
 - Quantum machine learning is trying to change the world of science and business by taking on the tasks of faster machine learning with less training and almost unlimited storage.
 - Searches could be run in fewer steps than done with classical algorithms with no need for structured data.
 - Cryptography brings a push to further advance for security purposes with quantum computing processes.
 - Optimization for problem solving is said to reveal solutions to problems and hurdles that were previously impossible. 

There is a theory that quantum-based tech will start showing up everywhere and many people believe that we will one day answer questions that come with revolutionary changes for the world. There is a growing number of startups and well known businesses that are investing in quantum computing. With all of the excitement and promise of huge commercialization opportunity there is a race to benchmark, stabilize and start making money.


## The Meat and Potatoes 

I found with some research that to ask who and what country is leading the race is a very cloudy one. There is constant development and overnight changes all around the globe. I can only imagine what they are not telling everyone too. With such powerful computers there is always a question of security in the race as well. Imagine if a computer that was designed to decrypt anything and was impossible to be hacked got into the hands of the wrong person or country. Quantum computers can either make or break our digital world, so the race is to both be in the forefront but also to not be an underdog in a world of computers that carry such potential harm.

From information that I gathered on hindustantimes.com, the most obvious front runner's of the global quantum computing race are China and the USA, as of today. I found where the University of Science and Technology of China revealed a pair of computers that utilized photonic quantum computing to be recognized as the most powerful quantum computers to date in October of 2021. HTTimes claimed that Zuchongchi 2.1, "can perform calculations that are a hundred times more complex than Google's Sycamore supercomputer can handle, while operating at 10 million times the speed of the world's fastest supercomputer." Zuchongchi 2.1 was comprised of 66 qubits. The second machine of the pair was still in prototype but had 113 photons.

A month later IBM in the United States of America announced they had built the Eagle. The Eagle processor is a 127 qubit system. This more than doubled the size and power of the previous Chinese versions. Dr. Dario Gil, Senior Vice President, IBM and Director of Research said, "The arrival of the Eagle processor is a major step towards the day when quantum computers can outperform classical computers for useful applications." When comparing Eagle to a modern day classical computer it is really crazy to think about. For a classical computer to represent a single state on the Eagle processor it would take more bits than the number of atoms in a living population of 7.5 billion people.

Quantum computing is very alluring and seems to be making huge leaps and bounds in terms of revolutionizing problem solving. Although this may seem, quantum computing still has a lot of improvements and things to figure out before commercialization is in order. Pretty much all of the systems that exist today are used for exploring future quantum applications. 


## Signing Out...

There is quite the hype that goes with quantum computing but they are not something that is going to replace our modern day classical computers. Quantum computers are still in stages of production that require refrigeration or a vacuum state to maintain stability. Any physical outside element will effect the qubits when they are at work and sending and receiving signals. Improvement in qubits, which are the main component to the idea of a quantum computation, are where I see the biggest focus. Many types and forms of qubits are being tested out there and when a flexible but stable qubit is discovered there will be a huge leap in quantum computing.

Let's all hope that quantum computing keeps going in a positive direction and we can maybe solve some revolutionary global problems. For now, the quantum race is on, a very big race with a very small(quantum) name.
